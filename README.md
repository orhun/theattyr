## TheaTTYr ðŸŽ¥

A terminal theater for playing [VT100 art and animations](http://artscene.textfiles.com/vt100).

> [!NOTE]  
> The [VT100](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT100), introduced by DEC in 1978, was among the first video terminals to support ANSI escape codes.
>
> The ANSI art scene used the VT100's animation capabilities, made possible by codes that allowed cursor movement, deletion, and character updates to create animated effects.
>
> Usually, they represent a long hand-crafted process done by a single person to tell a story. Some of these files may date back to the 1960's and 1970's.

> [!TIP]  
> I developed this tool over a series of livestreams, which you can check out [here](https://www.youtube.com/@orhundev/streams).
